Meera became the full-time stepmother to her husband’s two children who were in his majority custodial care when he was taken to family court by his ex-mother-in-law. In the course of this five-year battle, parental alienation and paternity fraud was discovered. Meera’s husband collapsed and was subsequently diagnosed with PTSD as a result. The immense devastation this caused her family spurred Meera into action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;">The huge inequity obvious in the family courts and the appalling processes involved in the child support system, as well as, the blatant lack of adequate legislation covering the victims of Parental Alienation and Paternity Fraud were unacceptable and Meera has worked continuously since 2016 to agitate for legislative change and educate the general public about the woeful state of mens rights. A double male suicide survivor, Meera has a particular interest in reforming the child support system and in pushing for mandatory DNA testing at birth, before any child support order can be created OR any child support assessment can be made against any man and also before any custodial case can be accepted to be heard at court.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;">Meera firmly believes this would assist hugely in cleaning up the false cases trammeling the family court and child support systems worldwide which would in turn ease the male suicide rates attributable to such woes.&nbsp;If mandatory DNA testing at birth is not acceptable to governments then Meera believes men should have the right to demand a DNA test regardless. Meera lives in Sydney, Australia with her husband and mother-in-law.</span></p>
