<p><span face="sans-serif" style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;">I am a wife, mother, and grandmother. I have worked in administration for the last 14 years. I studied child development for 2 years and was working on my bachelor's; double majoring in Psychology and sociology with a minor in criminal justice when we found out my husband was a victim of paternity fraud. I have had to take a break from school so that we can focus on the devastating effects that paternity fraud has had mentally and financially on my family. I have always had a passion for helping and being an advocate for children.</span></p>
