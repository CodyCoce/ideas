<!-- Paragraphs -->
<p>In recent years, our nation's courts have come to accept DNA evidence as absolute proof of innocence. Genetic evidence has been used to free death row inmates and it has been used to exonerate individuals wrongly convicted of rape and other crimes. Even so, courts have been slow to accept DNA as proof that a man should not have to pay child support.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, we are a nation in need of fathers; however, fatherhood is a consensual act made by men, who choose to have intimate relations or elect to adopt children. It is not a decision that can be made by courts that arbitrarily place financial responsibility for children on unrelated and unwilling men.</p>

<p>The children, who are the real victims in paternity fraud, deserve better than to have their support paid by extortion. Honoring the truth serves the best interests of the children and the community as a whole.</p>

<p>If courts have concerns about who will pay for a child's upbringing, they should implore mothers to tell the truth about their children's paternity and find the biological father. And in cases where mothers <strong>do</strong> truthfully disclose who the biological father is, states should go after the biological father. Failure to acknowledge DNA testing denies a child of their medical history; identity; father figure; and benefits such as inheritance, medical and life insurance, rights to social security and veterans benefits.</p>

<p>Paternity fraud is prevalent and has devastating consequences for men, women, and children. Most states have a limited time that one could contest paternity. After the statute of limitations is over, one would be responsible to pay child support until the child reaches 18 (or older in some states), even if DNA proves they are not the father.</p>

<p>All the best,</p>
