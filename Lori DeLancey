The deception was a dagger to the entire family unit, as her husband Scott had been a loving provider to the child for over 12 years.</span></span></span>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; color: #333333;">Their subsequent paternity fraud case resulted in complete relief from future child support, but it also meant the loss of a child. She was a sister, niece and cousin. The emotional loss combined with the financial ramifications was extremely stressful. Plus, there was the constant knowledge that they were deceived for over a decade. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; color: #333333;">Always the optimist, Lori has chosen to channel her energy into making the most of her unexpected education. While her family is rebuilding after legal fees and 13 years of support that may never be recovered, Lori is looking ahead. “Our family unit is stronger than ever. Our goal is to use our experience to help others and affect change in the legal system". By becoming an advocate for awareness of paternity fraud, Lori is determined to help other families. She is also eager to affect change in the court system so that similar cases may be decided in a more timely and cost effective manner. “We don’t want this to happen to anyone else. However, if it does, we want other families to view us as a resource. No one should have to navigate the system alone. It can be overwhelming.”</span></p>
