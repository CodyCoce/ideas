<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Alicia is a business owner in Southern California. Although many think that paternity fraud is just a&nbsp;men's issue&nbsp;both Alicia and her daughter are victims of paternity fraud and have been huge advocates for reform. Separated from her husband at the time her daughter was conceived, the state would only recognize her then husband as the father of her daughter and went after him&nbsp;for support. Not only did Alicia truthfully disclose that her husband&nbsp;was not&nbsp;the father...but DNA&nbsp;testing proved that the man she dated after being separated was the father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">In order for her daughter to receive financial support, medical, dental, vision insurance, and have claim to any Social Security benefits under her father's name the state would only recognize her ex-husband as the father and would not accept the truth. She would not go along with a lie and&nbsp;so she relinquished her ex-husband's rights so he would not be required to financially support her daughter. At this point, as far as the law is concerned her daughter is fatherless. For the past thirteen years Alicia has fought this ruling. She has had four trials and is working on our fifth. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Alicia believes that&nbsp;laws, policies, and the courts should stop perpetuating paternity fraud on innocent children and won't give up on working together with other paternity fraud victims on reform.</span></p>
