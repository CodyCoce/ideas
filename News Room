<p>Women Against Paternity Fraud (WAPF) made its public debut on national television on February 12, 2015. WAPF has a solid media campaign in place to educate the public and policy makers on the issue of paternity fraud.</p>
<p>To effectively make change we need to reach the masses by raising public awareness of our plight in order for there to be positive reform for our families and children. Increased public awareness is a first step that can lead to positive change for paternity fraud victims and their families. Therefore, this is an area in which we are working diligently, and with success.</p>
