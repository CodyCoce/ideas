She has been married for 41 years and has four grown sons, seventeen wonderful grandchildren and two great grandchildren.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Charlie is very proud and honored to be an Advisory Member for Women Against Paternity Fraud and supports the work the organization is doing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Charlie never knew her biological father. It wasn't until she was 50 years old that she was told by her brother that&nbsp;the wonderful man she thought was "Daddy"&nbsp;wasn't her father. This happened on the day of his burial so that her brother could receive the military flag. Charlie states, "No matter how old you are paternity fraud is extremely PAINFUL. ..." &nbsp;She supports reforming &nbsp;paternity laws and policies so that (children or adults) aren't one day blindsided by the very painful truth.</span></p>
