<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Jessica Kunze is a Nurse Practitioner in Southern California. She has witnessed many instances where the wrong man was being forced to pay child support for a child that was proven not be his. Being in the medical field Jessica believes that it is crucial that children know their medical history -- especially in emergency situations. &nbsp;<br /><br />Jessica states that she is grateful to be an Advisory Board Member of WAPF because she believes that the voices of victims of paternity fraud (many who are children) are not being heard and that change is needed.</span></p>
